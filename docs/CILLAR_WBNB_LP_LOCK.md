## CILLAR/WBNB V2 Liquidity Pool (LP) Lock

To ensure long-term liquidity stability and provide confidence to both investors and the community, the CILLAR team has locked all PancakeSwap LP tokens for the CILLAR/WBNB pair using **Unicrypt**, a trusted decentralized liquidity locking platform. Unicrypt allows token projects to securely lock liquidity for a predefined period, ensuring that the locked LP tokens cannot be withdrawn or tampered with, which provides transparency and builds trust with the community. Investors can continue to trade CILLAR on PancakeSwap as usual, and their ability to add or remove personal liquidity is unaffected; only the team’s portion of the LP tokens is locked, guaranteeing that there will always be a minimum amount of liquidity available for trading and protecting the token’s market stability.
