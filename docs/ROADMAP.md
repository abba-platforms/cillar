# 📍 CillarCoin Enterprise Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps needed to evolve CillarCoin into a fully enterprise-grade, CertiK-audit-passing, production-ready smart contract system.

----------

## ✅ PHASE 1: Governance & Upgradeability (Week 1–2)

Task

Description

🔁 Implement UUPS Proxy

Refactor `CillarCoin.sol` and `CillarVesting.sol` using OpenZeppelin’s `UUPSUpgradeable` pattern.

🧬 Split Logic & Storage

Separate logic contracts from storage layout for upgrade compatibility.

🔑 Add `initialize()`

Replace constructors with `initialize()` in all upgradeable contracts.

🔐 Protect with `initializer` modifier

Prevent re-initialization and enforce upgrade flow.

----------

## 🔐 PHASE 2: Role Granularity & DAO Hooks (Week 2–3)

Task

Description

🎭 Add Role Hierarchy

Define `FARE_MANAGER_ROLE`, `REWARD_ADMIN_ROLE`, `KYC_ADMIN_ROLE`, etc. using `AccessControl`.

🗳 DAO-ready Voting Skeleton

Scaffold upgrade hooks and settings (e.g., reward rate, price ceiling) to be future-controlled via token-based DAO.

🧱 Create Governance Interfaces

Prepare interfaces for off-chain governance platforms like Snapshot or Aragon integration.

----------

## 🛡 PHASE 3: Security, Monitoring & DevOps (Week 3–4)

Task

Description

✅ Unit Tests

Write full tests for all contracts (Hardhat + Mocha/Chai). Aim for **100% coverage**.

🧠 Static Analysis

Run `slither`, `mythx`, and `solhint` to detect vulnerabilities. Fix all critical/medium issues.

⚙️ CI/CD Pipelines

GitHub Actions to auto-build, lint, test, deploy, and verify.

🧯 Runtime Monitoring

Add Tenderly or Forta to track execution anomalies on testnet and mainnet.

----------

## 🔗 PHASE 4: Treasury & Compliance Architecture (Week 5–6)

Task

Description

🏛 TreasuryManager.sol

Move treasury logic out of `CillarCoin.sol` into a dedicated contract. Add withdraw roles and multisig control.

🧾 KYC Registry Contract

Build or integrate an ERC-734/735-compatible registry to manage on-chain verified identities.

🔍 Verification Metadata

Add verification links, tags, and metadata to BscScan after deployment.

----------

## 🌍 PHASE 5: Testnet Simulation & Governance UX (Week 7–8)

Task

Description

🌐 Deploy to BNB Testnet

Deploy full suite and run **multi-user simulation** of rides, refunds, rewards, vesting, etc.

📊 Track Gas Reports

Monitor and optimize expensive functions (e.g., ride payments, batch seed).

🧪 DAO Simulation

Run mock votes (off-chain via Snapshot or simulated on-chain) for parameters like `rewardThreshold`.

----------

## 📦 BONUS PHASE: Tokenomics & Docs (Ongoing)

Task

Description

📖 Whitepaper Update

Expand tokenomics and usage examples to reflect on-chain reward logic and DAO governance.

📦 GitHub Package

Publish as NPM-compatible Solidity package (optional).

🏷️ Version Tags

Create semver tags and CHANGELOG entries for each milestone.
