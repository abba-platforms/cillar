## 5. Tokenomics

**Token Name:** CillarCoin  
**Ticker Symbol:** CILLAR  
**Type:** Utility Token  
**Standard:** ERC-20 with extended logic for fare payments, refunds, rewards, and compliance mechanisms  
**Blockchain:** BNB Smart Chain  
**Decimals:** 18  
**Initial Price per Token:** $0.15 (USD)
**Initial Minted:** 15 billion (15,000,000,000) tokens  
**Max Supply Cap:** 100 billion (100,000,000,000) tokens

This supply design balances current adoption needs with long-term scalability. Only 15% of the total maximum supply is initially minted, allowing controlled inflation and phased adoption across geographies and sectors. Additional tokens will be minted in tranches based on milestone-driven release schedules, public infrastructure needs, and DAO-approved proposals.

**Allocation Breakdown:**

Component

Allocation

Purpose

Public Treasury

45%

Rewards for ridership, eco-behavior, participation, and community engagement. Also covers public service grants and operator subsidies.

Founders & Team

25%

Incentivizes sustained development, with long-term vesting to align team interests with ecosystem success.

Locked & Vested Supply

30%

Managed under smart contracts like `CillarVesting.sol` to ensure secure, predictable, and auditable release schedules tied to specific KPIs and ecosystem maturity milestones.

**Token Emission Policy:** The protocol follows a milestone-based emission model governed by the Cillar DAO. Token releases from the unminted 90 billion supply are tied to:

-   Geographic expansion milestones (e.g., launching in new cities)
-   Ecosystem integrations (e.g., activating new smart city services)
-   Liquidity provisioning and market pair creation
-   Reward pool replenishments based on usage data

**Token Utility:**

-   Primary medium for ride fare payments on AfrailX and ArailX
-   Access key for subscription services and urban packages
-   Reward and incentive distribution layer (CO2, community tasks)
-   Peer-to-peer payments in Cillar marketplaces
-   Governance weight for proposals and treasury allocation
-   Educational and vocational certification credits

**Burn Logic:** CillarCoin includes optional burn mechanisms tied to:

-   Ride refund penalties
-   Administrative overhead fee recycling
-   Governance-approved deflation policies

These functions may be toggled on or off by DAO votes depending on ecosystem performance, inflation tolerance, and token velocity metrics.
