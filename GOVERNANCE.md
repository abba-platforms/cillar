# GOVERNANCE

## Overview

CillarCoin adopts a hybrid governance model, combining core team leadership with transparent, open-source community participation. This approach ensures both executional clarity and decentralized insight, enabling Cillar to remain secure, mission-aligned, and adaptable.

## Governance Framework

- **Lead Maintainer**:  
  Abba Platforms Inc. (primary decision-maker and steward of the project)  
  Creator and Developer: Simon Kapenda (Founder & CTO)

- **Core Contributors**:  
  Selected developers and technical advisors with commit access to critical modules of the smart contracts and infrastructure.

- **Community Contributors**:  
  Any GitHub user may fork, clone, contribute, suggest changes, or raise issues via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

## Decision-Making Process

1. **Smart Contract Changes**:  
   All smart contract changes must go through peer review, testing, and audit review (when applicable). Pull requests will be reviewed by core contributors and the lead maintainer before merging.

2. **Major Protocol Changes**:  
   Governance proposals for tokenomics, rewards systems, and cross-chain bridges will be discussed openly in GitHub Discussions and may involve off-chain polling or voting when necessary.

3. **Emergency Fixes**:  
   In cases of exploits or security risks, the lead maintainer and designated operators may patch vulnerabilities without extended community review, but with full documentation post-fix.

## Community Participation

- Raise issues: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/abba-platforms/cillar/issues)
- Contribute code: [Pull Requests](https://github.com/abba-platforms/cillar/pulls)
- Discuss ideas: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/abba-platforms/cillar/discussions)

## Future DAO Transition (Planned)

The long-term roadmap includes gradual decentralization of governance to a Cillar DAO, where token holders may vote on proposals. This transition will occur once the ecosystem reaches critical adoption milestones and audit maturity.
