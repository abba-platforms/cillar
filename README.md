## What's CillarCoin?

**CillarCoin** ($CILLAR) is a programmable BEP-20 utility token created and developed by **Simon Kapenda**, the creator of **Abba App**, and maintained by **Abba Platforms Inc.** It is built to facilitate transit fare payments on **AfrailX** and **ArailX** smart mobility systems exclusively through the **Abba App**.

CillarCoin is designed to enable secure, flexible, and user-centric mobility payments within a decentralized infrastructure ecosystem, with future support for **community governance via DAO mechanisms** over key parameters such as rewards, pricing, and treasury allocation. See Cillar DAO website at cillar.org.

----------

## 🚇 Purpose

CillarCoin is designed to:

-   Pay for transit rides via Abba App on AfrailX and ArailX smart mobility systems
-   Earn ride rewards and loyalty bonuses
-   Enable regional, children and senior fare discounts
-   Track ride-based CO₂ emissions savings
-   Allow refundable transactions within defined windows
-   Support KYC-based user eligibility

These smart mobility systems—AfrailX in Africa and the Middle East, and ArailX in the U.S. and beyond—represent the future of clean, efficient, and scalable urban transit. CillarCoin enables seamless payments across these networks through a unified token ecosystem.

### 📄 CillarCoin Ecosystem – Infrastructure & Use Case Expansion Plan

A comprehensive, production-grade whitepaper detailing the technical, economic, and governance architecture of **CillarCoin ($CILLAR)** — a non-speculative BEP-20 utility token built on BNB Smart Chain.

**Key Highlights:**

-   Built-in reward, refund, and compliance logic
-   Region-customized smart contracts (FareRegistry, DAOManager, etc.)
-   Civic-focused DAO governance with non-transferable voting tokens
-   Progressive rollout model aligned with real-world infrastructure readiness
-   Visionary path to become Africa’s first decentralized civic utility currency

> This document serves as the blueprint for scaling blockchain-backed urban infrastructure, helping governments, NGOs, and enterprises deploy programmable public services with real-world impact.
