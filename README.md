## What's CillarCoin?

**CillarCoin** ($CILLAR) is a programmable BEP-20 utility token created and developed by **Simon Kapenda**, the creator of **Abba App**, and maintained by **Abba Platforms Inc.** It is built to facilitate transit fare payments on **AfrailX** and **ArailX** smart mobility systems exclusively through the **Abba App**.

CillarCoin is designed to enable secure, flexible, and user-centric mobility payments within a decentralized infrastructure ecosystem, with future support for **community governance via DAO mechanisms** over key parameters such as rewards, pricing, and treasury allocation. See Cillar DAO website at cillar.org.

----------

## üöá Purpose

CillarCoin is designed to:

-   Pay for transit rides via Abba App on AfrailX and ArailX smart mobility systems
-   Earn ride rewards and loyalty bonuses
-   Enable regional, children and senior fare discounts
-   Track ride-based CO‚ÇÇ emissions savings
-   Allow refundable transactions within defined windows
-   Support KYC-based user eligibility

These smart mobility systems‚ÄîAfrailX in Africa and the Middle East, and ArailX in the U.S. and beyond‚Äîrepresent the future of clean, efficient, and scalable urban transit. CillarCoin enables seamless payments across these networks through a unified token ecosystem.
